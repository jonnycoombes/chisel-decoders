# Chisel - Decoders

[![Rust](https://github.com/jonnycoombes/chisel-decoders/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonnycoombes/chisel-decoders/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

 ## Overview

 This repository contains a very simple, lean implementation of a decoder that will consume `u8` bytes from a given
 `Read` implementation, and decode into the Rust internal `char` type using UTF-8 . This is an offshoot lib from an
 ongoing toy parser project, and is used as the first stage of the scanning/lexing phase of the parser in order avoid
 unnecessary allocations during the `u8` sequence -> `char` conversion.

 Note that the implementation is pretty fast and loose, and under the covers utilises some bit-twiddlin' in conjunction
 with the *unsafe* `transmute` function to do the conversions. *No string allocations are used during conversion*.
 There is minimal checking (other than bit-masking) of the inbound bytes - it is not intended to be a full-blown UTF8
 validation library, although improved/feature-flagged validation may be added at a later date.

 ### Usage

 Usage is very simple, provided you have something that implements `Read` in order to source some bytes:

 ### Create from a slice

 Just wrap your array in a reader, and then plug it into a new instance of `Utf8Decoder`:

 ```rust
     use std::io::BufReader;
     use chisel_decoders::utf8::Utf8Decoder;

     let buffer: &[u8] = &[0x10, 0x12, 0x23, 0x12];
     let reader = BufReader::new(buffer);
     let _decoder = Utf8Decoder::new(reader);
 ```

 ### Create from a file

 Just crack open your file, wrap in a `Read` instance and then plug into a new instance of `Utf8Decoder`:

 ```rust
     use std::fs::File;
     use std::io::BufReader;
     use std::path::PathBuf;
     use chisel_decoders::utf8::Utf8Decoder;

     let path = PathBuf::from("./Cargo.toml");
     let f = File::open(path);
     let reader = BufReader::new(f.unwrap());
     let _decoder = Utf8Decoder::new(reader);
 ```
 ### Consuming `char`s

 You can either pull out new `char`s from the decoder wrapped inside a `Result` type:

 ```rust
     use std::fs::File;
     use std::io::BufReader;
     use std::path::PathBuf;
     use chisel_decoders::utf8::Utf8Decoder;

     let path = PathBuf::from("./Cargo.toml");
     let f = File::open(path);
     let reader = BufReader::new(f.unwrap());
     let decoder = Utf8Decoder::new(reader);
     loop {
         let result = decoder.decode_next();
         if result.is_err() {
             break;
         }
     }
 ```
 Alternatively, you can just use the `Utf8Decoder` as an `Iterator`:

 ```rust
     use std::fs::File;
     use std::io::BufReader;
     use std::path::PathBuf;
     use chisel_decoders::utf8::Utf8Decoder;

     let path = PathBuf::from("./Cargo.toml");
     let f = File::open(path);
     let reader = BufReader::new(f.unwrap());
     let decoder = Utf8Decoder::new(reader);
     for c in decoder {
        println!("char: {}", c)
     }
 ```

## Building and Testing

As you would expect, just `cargo build` in order to build the crate.
